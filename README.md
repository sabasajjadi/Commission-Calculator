## Goal
Calculate the total commission earned by a sales rep for a given period of time

## Required Python Packes Instruction:
All required packages are included in the file. 

## Details of the code
I wrote a python code to calculate the total commission for specific sales rep during specific time period. My code has two functions. The first one is called load_dataframes() which is a helper function to check datasets were imported successfully and the second function is called total_commission() which is getting sales_rep_name, start_date, and end_date as an input and in result will return the total commission amount based on the input criteria.

### Unit Tests Function
You can call the Unit test function "test_total_commission()" which will allow you test different cases to make sure the code is working without any issues. 

### Error Handling Furnction "total_commission_with_error_handling" (Advanced function to calulate the commision for user)
This function is the advance and improved version of the "total_commision()"" which will allow user to test different scenarios based on the input values, in order to avoid errors or breaks while running the function (it will be useful when working with bigger datasets).
